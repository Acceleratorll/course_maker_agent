This project is an AI-powered agent that automatically generates structured course content based on a given topic and target audience. It leverages **LangGraph** to orchestrate a series of steps involving Large Language Models (LLMs) and web search to create objectives, gather knowledge, write lessons, and summarize the course.

The agent is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with a **Gradio** frontend for easy interaction.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Automated Objective Creation:** Generates clear learning objectives based on the course topic and target audience.
*   **Web-Powered Knowledge Retrieval:** Searches the web (via Tavily Search) for relevant and up-to-date information related to the course objective.
*   **Structured Lesson Generation:** Creates detailed lessons including:
    *   Title
    *   Introduction
    *   Benefits
    *   Core Content
    *   Conclusion
    *   Description
    *   Actionable Tips
*   **Course Summarization:** Provides a concise summary of the generated course content.
*   **Modular & Stateful Workflow:** Built with LangGraph for a clear, debuggable, and extensible multi-step process.
*   **Interactive Frontend:** Easy-to-use Gradio interface hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.

## üìñ Usage (Gradio Interface)

1.  Navigate to the [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Tyullix14/course_maker).
2.  You will see a single input for prompt:
3.  Enter Prompt(make sure contains e.g., course, lessons, class, modules).
4.  Click the "Generate Course" (or similar) button.
5.  The agent will process the request through the different stages. This might take a few moments.
6.  The generated course components (Objective, Knowledge snippets, Lesson, Summary) will be displayed on the page.

## üí° Future Enhancements & Potential Improvements

‚úÖ Refine parsing data to PDF
‚úÖ Add RAG
‚òê **Implement `Prerequisite` and `Homework` Generation:** Activate and integrate nodes for generating prerequisites and homework assignments into the `CourseState` and workflow.

*Generated with the help of AI, fine-tuned by a human.*
